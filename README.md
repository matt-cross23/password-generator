# password-generator
This project attempts to test the coder's knowledge of Javascript by engaging them in the basics of the language. I was able to apply knowledge of arrays, conditional statements, for and while loops to generate a user-friendly password. Applying logic to functions made my understanding of Javascript much greater.
